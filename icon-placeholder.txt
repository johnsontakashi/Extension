ICON FILES NEEDED:

Since this is a text-based environment, I cannot create actual PNG image files.
You will need to create or download the following icon files:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

OPTION 1 - Create Simple Icons:
- Use any image editor (MS Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
- Create solid color squares in the required sizes
- Save as PNG format
- Suggested colors: Blue (#007bff) or Green (#28a745)

OPTION 2 - Download Icons:
- Search for "Chrome extension icon" on icon websites
- Use free icon resources like Flaticon, Icons8, or similar
- Ensure icons are square and the right dimensions

OPTION 3 - Remove Icons (Alternative):
If you don't want icons, remove this section from manifest.json:

  "icons": {
    "16": "icon16.png",
    "48": "icon48.png", 
    "128": "icon128.png"
  }

The extension will work without icons (Chrome will use a default icon).
